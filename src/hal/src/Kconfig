        The power management subsystem can automatically shutdown the system.
        The shutdown time in minutes is defined in platform_defaults_* for
        the specific platform and is the time since the last radio communication
        occured.

    help
        Using DMA to receive uart data reduces CPU load and will free
        up recources for other things. DMA is a shared resource though
        and might conflict with other functionality in the future.
