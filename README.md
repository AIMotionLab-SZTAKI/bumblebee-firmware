Branch with initial implementation of MD5 hash calculation on ESP32. The added features are not complete and may not function.

The added features are split into two commits;
1. Function to request ESP32 to calculate MD5 hash for a certain memory region, comparison with a hard-coded MD5 hash.
2. Functionality to calculate MD5 hash of the to-be flashed ESP32 firmware on the STM32 side (during flashing of ESP32 from STM32), comparison with requested ESP32 MD5 hash.
